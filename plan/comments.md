# Comments about the plan

It is good to start from simple, but I hope that you will be able to
come up with a little more complicated model than two streets and one
crossing with traffic lights. A grid architecture is fine, but
hopefully there are a bit more streets so that cars may cross over
multiple streets.

Regarding extension priorities on second page, I would have pleasing graphics
on quite low priority, as long as there is somehow clear and
understandable graphical representation. Fast forward would be a very
useful feature. One useful feature could be to load a city map from a
configuration file, and ability to control the spawn time (random)
distribution, and traffic light timings. This could be either
interactive through GUI, or from config file. Hopefully there are some
thoughts about the UI design in general.

Distribution of roles seems like there is only one
programmer. Hopefully everyone writes some code to the
project. Hopefully you also have thoughts about testing early
enough. For example, are you planning to have some unit testing
procedure during development.

The schedule seems realistic, and I would aim to have a
feature-complete version at least a week before deadline to leave
enough time for testing and fixing. I guess you want to have
intermediate GUI versions already before 7.12.

On which platforms are you developing and testing the project? Aalto
Linux was an "official" requirement, but if you happen to make it Mac
(Sierra) compatible, I don't complain to be able to test it on my own
laptop.
